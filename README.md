# 2D_WPM

This code was written to assess the performances of the two dimensional Wave Propagation Method algorithm when using CUDA. The project's objective was to evaluate the potential performance improvement when using GPUs, before considering the implementation of more complex versions of the algorithm, namely the three dimensional case and the Vector WPM.

This work was done during an intership with Ziti (Insitut Für Technische Informatik, Universität Heidelberg), with the guidance of Holger Fröning and Matthias Fertig.
