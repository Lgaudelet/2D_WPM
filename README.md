# 2D_WPM

In this work, we assess the performances of the two dimensional Wave Propagation Method algorithm when using CUDA. The project's objective is to evaluate the potential performance improvement when using GPUs, before considering the implementation of more complex versions of the algorithm, namely the three dimensional case and the Vector WPM.

This work was done during an intership with Ziti, with the guidance of Holger Fr√∂ning and Matthias Fertig.
